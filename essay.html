<h1>Essay</h1>

<section class="post-content">

<p>I started college in engineering because someone ahead of me said it was a hard major to switch into. I was good at math and didn't program in high school, so it felt like a good place to be. My first class was Calculus 3 with a Harvard Phd. (The material I have retained, near to a T, has a <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Number</a> of 2 from a top 10 school. An MIT Phd taught me physics, a Berkeley Phd taught me Control Systems, and a Cornell Phd taught me Optimal Control, System Theory, and DSP. Top schools attract and graduate top Phds. I guess Vermont was a nice place for them to take a job and raise a family.)

<p>I chose my major on the last day possible. Civil engineers wanted to manage extensive construction projects, environmental engineers wanted to work outdoors, mechanical engineers wanted to work with machines, and electrical engineers wanted to get jobs. I wanted a job, but I had neither the interest nor aptitute to build circuits and design sensors, so I circled the electrical engineering floor until I found a research poster without any pictures of hardware on it.
  
<p>One poster was particularly interesting. It had LaTeX equations and code on it - it was the design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I met with the professor responsible and asked him if companies paid people to do what he did in his research. He plainly put forward that it's hard to find a 21st century electrical engineer worth his salt who does not know how to design and program algorithms, and, in fact, his project was funded by a company. When I asked him If I needed a math minor, he furrowed his brow, and I will not forget what he said, "That would be like minoring in circuits; math is a focus not a minor. If you want to do higher level math, go and study control". When I asked him if I had to build anything with my hands, he knowingly laughed and said, "not if you understand control and can program". I submitted my major declaration on my phone as I walked out of the building. By graduation, I had taken every control course offered by the electrical engineering department. 
  
<p>The nature of my thesis was then not surprising. I wanted to program and to use what I learned in my courses, so I programmed a randomized routing algorithm. With 64 agents with individual utility functions competing for a finite number of packets, the code I wrote took 35 minutes to run on the 2.4 GHz two core processor in my Macbook Pro. When debugging in the final weeks of my degree, I would insert print statements and nap until I could read them when my script finished running. I don't know if I would have been so precise had I used the four core machine I have now. 
  
<p>Comprehensible plots in hand I left for the engineering building to put up posters for my thesis defense - design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I presented without a hiccup and even got to explain what happened when more states were added to the finite state automaton.  

<p>It got me a job, but looking back I would have done EE even if no one was hiring.
