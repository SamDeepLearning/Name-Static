<h1>Essay</h1>

<section class="post-content">

<p>I started college in engineering because someone ahead of me said it was a hard major to switch into. I was good at math and didn't program in high school, so it felt like a good place to be. My first class was Calculus 3 with a Harvard Phd. (The coursework I've retained, near to a T, has a <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Number</a> of 2 from a top 10 school. An MIT Phd taught me physics, a Berkeley Phd taught me Control Systems, and a Cornell Phd taught me Optimal Control, System Theory, and DSP. Top schools graduate far more Phds than exist tenure-track openings.)

<p>Choosing an engineering discipline was not hard. Civil engineers wanted to manage large construction projects. Environmental engineers wanted to work outdoors. And mechanical engineers wanted to work with machines. Electrical engineers wanted to get jobs. I did not want to know or want to know how to build circuits and program microcontrollers, but I did want a job, so I circled the electrical engineering floor until I found a research poster that didn't have pictures of hardware on it. It was a routing algorithm. I found the professor responsible and he blithely remarked that electrical engineers can solely design and program algorithms. I had started programming independently after mandatory CS 21, so I chose EE.
