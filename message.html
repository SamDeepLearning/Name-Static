<P>Dear Reader, <BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>You probably know I am into software and starting companies. I am always looking for
one-liners and essays from people who I have met in the last 10 years of work and recreational activities. 
Remind me who you are so I can remember. I spend a lot of time looking at other people's work on Github and not
a lot of time checking email so open an issue on a Github project of mine and I'll definitely see it. 
<BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>I estimate that about 90% of the outcome comes from about 10% of the work. I did a lot of work on
hardware and embedded system programming in Electrical Engineering that will probably never be put to use.
I spend so much time on pure software development now, those days are pretty much over. EE was a great foundation though.

<P>I am always looking to partner with researchers at academic instutions to write grants with you.
I haven't had success with a mobile app grant yet, and <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">I think it's because it's too easy to get one off the 
ground with no money.</a><BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR

<P>Web and SEO is really interesting too. Finding a good domain is arduous. I've written some scripts to scrape
expired domain lists and return domains that I think are interesting but I've had more success just blind searching.
Digital marketing is not out of the question as a business venture sometime soon and it comes up from time to time.</P>
