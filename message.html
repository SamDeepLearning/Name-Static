<BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>Dear Reader, <BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>Thanks for visiting. I am interested in software and starting businesses. Nothing notable to report yet.
I am always happy to receive one-liners and longer notes from people who I have met in the last 10 years of work through the WEB and through living <A HREF ="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/the-20s-at-home-in-vermont-2015-2a9fab113d10#.gczdt5gx2.">a good life in Vermont</a>. 
Don't be a stranger. If we've never met, that's ok but an intro is good. I spend a lot of time looking at people's work on Github and Indie Hackers and a lot of time trying to emulate what I like - but not a lot of time on email - so my advice is to look at my code first on Github
and contact me about something interesting you have already done that is similar. LinkedIn works too.

<P>I estimate that about 90% of my outcomes have come from about 10% of the work. As far as academics go, that 10% is my CS training. I did a lot of work on
hardware and embedded system programming in Electrical Engineering. I spend all my time on application software and development now. The hardware days are pretty much over, but EE was 
a <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">great foundation</a>.
<BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>I do have a good body of <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">coding experience</a>. by now. I'm always looking to partner with researchers at academic instutions to write grants with you, as well as individuals in industry, but I don't think focusing a whole business on a mobile app is the way to go anymore.
  I think there is space for grants that include mobile applications, but from what I've seen they have to be about making a really positive difference in people's lives and not worrying about revenue. 
It's hard to pitch a purely recreational and social app when Facebook, SnapChat, and Instagram have had a 7 year headstart on whatever your idea is. If you want to go that route, it's a really crowded market but from experience NSF is at least willing to entertain <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/review-comments-from-a-declined-ios-nsf-sbir-phase-i-proposal-b2544f2056e7#.ewilsji6i">these proposals.</a><BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR

<P>Web and SEO is really interesting too. Finding a good domain for your company is arduous. I've written some scripts to scrape
expired domain lists and return domains that I think are interesting, but I've had more success just blind searching idiomatic abbreviations and unnatural combinations of keywords. Again, nothing interesting to report yet.
Digital marketing is not out of the question as a business sometime soon and <A HREF="http://www.vahula.com">it comes up from time to time</a>. It's also pretty crowded, or at least it seems that way here on the East Coast. But there are nice ways to do it and it is definitely a service a lot of people need.</P>
