<BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>Dear Reader, <BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>Thanks for visiting. I am interested in software and starting businesses. Nothing notable to report yet.
I am always happy to receive one-liners and longer notes from people who I have met in the last 10 years of work through the WEB and through living <A HREF ="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/the-20s-at-home-in-vermont-2015-2a9fab113d10#.gczdt5gx2.">a good life in Vermont</a>. 
Don't be a stranger. If we've never met, that's ok but an intro is good. I spend a lot of time looking at people's work on Github and Indie Hackers and a lot of time trying to emulate what I like - but not a lot of time on email - so my advice is to look at my code first on Github
and contact me about something interesting you have already done that is similar. LinkedIn works too. </P>

<P>I estimate that about 90% of my outcomes have come from about 10% of the work. As far as academics go, that 10% is my CS training. I did a lot of work on
hardware and embedded system programming in EE. Now I spend all my time on application software and development. My hardware days are basically over, but EE was 
a <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">good foundation</a>. </P>

<P>I do have a good body of <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">coding experience</a>. by now. I'm always looking to partner with researchers at academic instutions or individuals in industry, but I don't think focusing a whole business on a mobile app is the way to go anymore.
  I think there is space for grants that include mobile apps, but from what I've seen they have to be about making a really positive difference in people's lives and not worrying about revenue. 
It's hard to pitch a purely recreational and social app when Facebook, SnapChat, and Instagram have had a 7 year headstart on whatever your idea is. If you want to go that route, it's a really crowded market but from experience NSF is at least willing to entertain your <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/review-comments-from-a-declined-ios-nsf-sbir-phase-i-proposal-b2544f2056e7#.ewilsji6i">fallible proposal.</a> </P>

<P>Web and SEO is interesting too. It's not as cool as deep learning, but it really matters. Finding a good domain for your company is arduous. I've written some scripts to scrape
expired domain lists and return domains that I think are interesting, but I've had more success just blind searching idiomatic abbreviations and unnatural combinations of keywords. There are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/warren-royal-bobbleheadscom_n_1571356.html"> unicorns </a> out there that bought a really good name at an auction but I think you have to really get into this opportunistic mindset to do well. Unfortunately hanging out at online auctions (designing them is a different story) is just so, not, that, interesting...
The idea of starting a business just off of a random domain name though <i>is</i> interesting. The man in the previous link, "bought the domain name for Bobbleheads.com at an auction, though his previous experience with the iconic toys consisted of him owning a few and thinking they were ‘cool’." Now that's cool.</p>
  
<p>Digital marketing itself is not out of the question either and <A HREF="http://www.putnamholson.com">it comes up from time to time</a> as a way to maybe make a living on something that can scale someday and live well in VT, US at the same time. If you're reading this from outside VT or the US, it's no different in terms of collaborating on an idea (of which each of his has taken a hack at in some way separately beforehand) someday. 
Advertising and marketing itself is also pretty crowded, or at least it seems that way here on the East Coast. But there are nice ways to do it and it is definitely a service a lot of people need. The older I get the less picky I get with business ideas. The reason I spend so much time messing around in all of these different domains is so I can maybe be in the right place at the right time down the road. </P>
  
<P>Thanks for reading. If you read the whole thing why don't you send me a one-line email as a passing hello. Why not? I'll send a one-line back and we can just leave it at that - one passing high five to break up the typical misfortune of mutual work-interest but missed connections.</p>
