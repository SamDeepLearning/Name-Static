<P><STRONG>A Message from Sam Putnam, Developer.</STRONG>

<P>Dear Reader, <BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR wp="br2" CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P>You probably know I am interested in software and starting companies. I am always looking for
one-liners and essays from people who I have met in the last 10 years of work through the WEB and through living<A HREF ="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/the-20s-at-home-in-vermont-2015-2a9fab113d10#.gczdt5gx2."> a good life in Vermont</a>. 
Remind me who you are so I can remember. I spend a lot of time looking at people's work on Github and Indiehackers and
a lot of time trying to emulate what I like but not a lot of time on email so contact me through Github, or LinkedIn works too.

<P>I estimate that about 90% of an outcome comes from about 10% of the work. I did a lot of work on
hardware and embedded system programming in Electrical Engineering that will probably never be put to use.
I spend so much time on pure software development now, so those hardware days are pretty much over. EE was a great foundation though. 
<A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/it-looks-like-you-majored-in-electrical-engineering-why-not-computer-science-c142ac5d1668#.d3l157127">great foundation</a> though.

<P>I am always looking to partner with researchers at academic instutions to write grants with you.
I haven't had success with a mobile app grant yet, but there's space for one's that help people. 
It is hard to get funding when the big social apps we all use came out a full 7 years ago now. It's a really <A HREF="https://medium.com/@SamPutnam/review-comments-from-a-declined-ios-nsf-sbir-phase-i-proposal-b2544f2056e7#.ewilsji6i">crowded market.</a><BR wp="br1" CLEAR="ALL"><BR

<P>Web and SEO is really interesting too. Finding a good domain is arduous. I've written some scripts to scrape
expired domain lists and return domains that I think are interesting, but I've had more success just blind searching so far.
Digital marketing is not out of the question as a business venture sometime soon and it comes up from time to time. 
There are nice ways to do it and it is definitely a service people need.</P>
