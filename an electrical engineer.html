<h1>An Electrical Engineer</h1>
<p><time datetime="2016-11-02">November 2016</time></p>
<section class="post-content">

<p>I started in engineering because someone ahead of me told me it was a hard major to switch into. I was good at math and didn't program in high school, so it seemed like the right place to be. My first class was Calculus 3 with a Harvard Phd. (I can't omit that the coursework I use today has a <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon Number</a> of 1-2 from a top 10 school. An MIT Phd taught me physics, a Berkely Phd taught be Control Systems, and a Cornell Phd taught me Optimal Control, System Theory, and DSP. Pattern matching might be taboo, but its my profession.) 

<p>Choosing an engineering discipline was not hard. Civil engineers wanted to manage large construction projects. Environmental engineers wanted to work outdoors. And mechanical engineers wanted to work with machines. Electrical engineers wanted to get jobs. I did not want to know how to build circuits and program microcontrollers, but I did want a job. I walked around the electrical engineering floor until I found a research poster that didn't have any pictures of hardware on it. It was an algorithm to charge electric vehicles. I found the professor and he assured me that there are in fact entire branches of electrical engineering based upon implementing algorithms in computer programs. I had taken my first programming class at this point and had no trouble. So I signed up to be an electrical engineer.
