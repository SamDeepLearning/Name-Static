<h1>It looks like you majored in electrical engineering. Why not computer science?</h1>
<p><time datetime="2016-11-02">November 2016</time></p>
<section class="post-content">

<p>As a developer, I get a version of this question a lot. The best answer I have does not explain why I didn't major in Computer Science, but why I did major in Electrical Engineering. I hope this is a useful re-telling of why I majored in electrical engineering for other developers who are asked similar questions and also reflect on them.
  
<p>I started college in engineering because someone ahead of me said it was a hard major to switch into. I was good at math and didn't program in high school, so it felt like a good place to be. My first class was Calculus 3 with a Harvard Phd. To this day, the material I have retained seems to have a <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Number</a> of 2 from a top 10 school. An MIT Phd taught me physics, a Berkeley Phd taught me Control Systems, and a Cornell Phd taught me Optimal Control, System Theory, and DSP. Top schools attract and graduate top Phds, and it seemed Vermont was an attractive place for a Phd to start a family.

<p>I chose my major on the last day possible. Civil engineers wanted to work with people, environmental engineers wanted to work outdoors, mechanical engineers wanted to work with machines, and electrical engineers wanted to get jobs. I wanted a job, but I had neither the interest nor aptitute to build circuits and design sensors, so I circled the electrical engineering floor until I found a research poster without any pictures of hardware on it.
  
<p>I found what I was looking for on a poster with Maxwell's Equations on it, but as I continued the loop of the engineering floor, I noticed another poster that had both LaTeX expressions <em> and </em> code on it. It looked like it might have an application I could understand, too - it was the design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I met with the professor responsible and asked him if companies paid engineers to do what he did as an academic. He plainly put forward the example of his own project, which was jointly developed with engineers and funded by their employer. When I asked him If I needed a math minor to be one of those engineers, he furrowed his brow, and I will not forget what he said, "an electrical engineer minoring in math is like an economist minoring in finance; math is a requirement and a focus, not a minor. Electrical engineers who need higher level math study control or electromagnetism." When I asked him if I had to build anything with my hands, he knowingly laughed and said, "you could work in either electromagnetics and optics or in control, but if you're interested in scheduling algorithms, you might try control." I submitted my major declaration on my phone as I walked out of the building. By graduation, I had taken every control course offered by the electrical engineering department. 
  
<p>The nature of my thesis was then not surprising. I wanted to program and to use what I learned in my courses, so I programmed a randomized routing algorithm. With 64 agents having individual utility functions and competing for a variable number of packets at each epoch, the code I wrote took 35 minutes to run on the two core processor in my Macbook Pro. When debugging during the final weeks of my degree, I would insert print statements and nap until I could read them all at once when my script finished. If I had used the four core machine I have now, I don't think I would have ended up with such a lean program. At the very least, the algorithm might have been underdeveloped if it had been finished early and relegated from its position as the <a  href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">top</a> idea in my mind. 
  
<p>Comprehensible results in hand I left for the engineering building to put up posters for my thesis defense - the design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I presented the material I planned to and when probed was acceptably able to explain the result of adding additional states to the finite state automaton.  

<p>It got me a job, but in hindsight I would have done research and EE if no one was hiring. I have been told by other engineers that I have an unnaturally long attention span to technical tasks. I attribute this entirely to electrical engineering. Half of the EE class had switched out by graduation and no one had switched in. The 17 people I graduated with were stalwarts. I doubt they're unemployed, but I would hire any of them.  

<p>If I had considered electrical engineering apriori, it would have been immediately eliminated. But I didn't do that; I first experienced engineering. For the student whose inspiration is unsteerable, deciding on a major is an NP-complete problem; if you've picked the right major, it becomes trivial to show this upon graduation, but there is no sure-fire way to quickly decide on any given major. Without knowing how long it will take to find a solution, approximating one is the best bet. I would consider the three-quarters of the year spent in school during each of the, at most, two underclassmen years before having to decide on a major to be linear in the number of possible majors. If you overexplore, e.g. with depth-first search, you might run out of time diving too deep, missing a good approximation that was right in front of you. But if you go with breadth-first search, your likelihood of finding and exploring, in linear time, one of the few nodes that is an optimal solution, goes out the window. It gets even harder if these optimal majors are under distinct disciplines, e.g. a studio art major and an electrical engineering major.

<p>To close, I would advocate not for the shortest path BFS search but for (the memoized version of) DFS. Repeated branching is an inevitability of decision making under a finite lifespan. In short, it becomes necessary to decide on a major before the money-making years are squandered. For me, electrical engineering was not obviously an optimal solution, but having graduated I can mark it as one, and as is the case with a solved NP-Complete problem, a whole class of problems becomes efficiently reducible and solvable if that knowledge is re-used. To say this another way, just as we know that indiscriminately deleting code in order to optimize a function from scratch is unbecoming, failing to re-use old knowledge on new problems, i.e., ignoring our profound ability to learn hierarchical abstractions - which advanced ml methods including <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=furfdqtdAvc&feature=youtu.be&t=1h37m36s">dl</a> do not possess - wastes useful information that could help make future decisions. In one sentence, memorylessness is a wasteful feature that is presently inherent in machines and, although ill-advised, can be turned on by humans. Rather than indiscriminately taste courses from the full breadth of disciplines upon arriving at college, remember what you liked in high school, and consider starting there. Start in engineering. You might never switch out.
