<h1>It looks like you majored in electrical engineering. Why not computer science?</h1>
<p><time datetime="2016-11-02">November 2016</time></p>
<section class="post-content">

<p>As a developer, I get a version of this question a lot. The best answer I have does not explain why I didn't major in computer science, but why I did major in electrical engineering. I hope this is a useful re-telling of why I majored in electrical engineering for other developers who are asked and think about similar questions.
  
<p>I started college in engineering. Someone ahead of me said it was a hard major to switch into, and I was good at math and didn't program in high school, so it felt like a good place to be. My first class was Calc 3, with a professor I understood well from Harvard.<a href="#identifier">[1]</a>

<p>After a year of checking off general requirements, It was time to choose my engineering major. Civil engineers wanted to work with people, environmental engineers wanted to work outdoors, mechanical engineers wanted to work with machines, and electrical engineers wanted to get jobs. I wanted a job, but I had neither the interest nor aptitute to build circuits and design sensors, so I circled the electrical engineering floor until I found a research poster without any pictures of hardware on it.
  
<p>I found what I was looking for on a poster with Maxwell's Equations on it, but as I continued the loop of the engineering floor, I noticed another poster that had both LaTeX expressions <em> and </em> code on it. It looked like it might have an application I could understand, too - it was the design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I met with the professor responsible and asked him if companies paid engineers to do what he did as an academic. He plainly put forward the example of his own project, which was jointly developed with engineers and funded by their employer. When I asked him If I needed a math minor to be one of those engineers, he stolidly put forward, "math is a requirement and a focus, not a minor<a href="#identifier2">[2]</a>. Electrical engineers who need higher level math study control or electromagnetism."<a href="#identifier3">[3]</a> When I asked him if I had to build anything with my hands, his response was, "you could work in electromagnetics, maybe optics, or in control, but if you're interested in algorithms, you might try control." I submitted my major declaration on my phone as I walked out of the building. For me, the definitiveness of getting a job coupled with the assuredness of learning more math and using what I learned in computer programs was necessary and sufficient to call the search over and dive in. By graduation, I had taken every control course offered by the electrical engineering department. 
  
<p>The nature of my thesis was then not surprising. I wanted to program and to use what I learned in my courses, so I programmed a randomized routing algorithm. With 64 agents having individual utility functions and competing for a variable number of packets at each epoch, the code I wrote took 35 minutes to run on the two core processor in my Macbook Pro. When debugging during the final weeks of my degree, I would insert print statements and nap until I could read them all at once when my script finished. If I had used the four core machine I have now, I don't think I would have ended up with such a lean program. At the very least, the algorithm might have been flawed had it been completed quickly, i.e. it might have been prematurely relegated from the coveted <a  href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">top</a> position in my mind where it had been allowed time to gestate.
  
<p>Comprehensible results in hand I left for the engineering building to put up posters for my thesis defense - the design and analysis of a routing algorithm. I presented the material I planned to and when probed was acceptably able to explain the result of adding additional states to the finite state automaton.  

<p>It got me a job, but in hindsight I would have done research and EE if no one was hiring. I have been told by other engineers that I have an unnaturally long attention span to technical tasks. I attribute this entirely to electrical engineering. Half of the EE class had switched out by graduation and no one had switched in. The 17 people I graduated with were stalwarts.  

<p>If I had considered electrical engineering apriori, it would have been immediately eliminated. But I didn't do that; I first experienced engineering. For the student whose inspiration is unsteerable, deciding on a major is (generally) an NP-complete problem; if you've picked the right major, it (generally) becomes trivial to show this upon graduation, but there is no sure-fire way to quickly decide on any given major. Without knowing how long it will take to find a solution, approximating one is the best bet. It's realistic to consider the three-quarters of the year spent in school, during each of the (at the very most 3) underclassmen years before having to decide on a major, to be linear in the number of possible majors. If you start with one discipline and move downwards, e.g. with depth-first search, you might run out of time diving too deep, missing a good approximation that was right in front of you. But if you go with breadth-first search, your likelihood of exploring every discipline and having the time to drop down one level to find and explore, in linear time, one of the few nodes in the tree of all majors that is an optimal solution, goes out the window. It is particularly hard to find an optimal major if your seed is a discipline in which you have no optimal majors, e.g. art, which might be considered far from engineering in your algorithm.

<p>To close, I would advocate for depth first search, as the shortest path search, breadth first search, will simply not converge in the short time required to pick a major. Repeated branching is an inevitability of decision making under a finite lifespan. In the case of picking a major, it becomes necessary to graduate before the money-making years are squandered, and for some, the space of choices diminishes even more as those majors that if switched into would push graduation back become infeasible. In my case, electrical engineering was not obviously an optimal solution, but having graduated and learned a great deal I <em>can</em> mark it as one, and as is the case with any solved NP-Complete problem, a whole class of problems becomes efficiently reducible and solvable <a href="#identifier4">[4]</a> if that knowledge - the experience of choosing and graduating in electrical engineering - is re-used. 

<p>Something that becomes clear after programming for a while is that deleting large chunks of code in order to optimize a function from scratch is generally unlikely to produce a faster or simpler function. In a similar fashion, failing to re-use old knowledge on new problems, i.e., ignoring our profound ability to learn hierarchical abstractions, to apply solutions from old problems to new ones, something which even advanced ml methods - including <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=furfdqtdAvc&feature=youtu.be&t=1h37m36s">dl</a> - is wasteful. In one sentence, this memorylessness of failing to learn from past problems is a wasteful feature, inherent in machines, but also, with ill-advised purpose, present in the decision making of humans who fall victim to starting from scratch, and this decision problem of picking and from the successive choices within in a major is a foundational one that can usefully frame a successful career.<a href="#identifier5">[5]</a>

<p>It does not have to be so.
  
<p>Rather than indiscriminately taste courses from the full breadth of disciplines upon arriving at college, it is wise to remember what you liked in high school, and consider starting there. If you liked math and didn't program in high school, you might start in engineering, and move into electrical engineering. If you find you like it there, you might never switch out. 
    
<p>To go further, if you become a developer and write a short essay about your choices, please post it on the web so I might come across it. I am still searching for a simple answer to the title of this article.
 
<p><a name="identifier">[1]</a> I didn't expect the alma mater of a professor to indicate teaching ability, because some professors are so fascinated with their research that they do not teach well. That said, to this day, the course material I have retained seems to have a <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon #</a> of 2 from a top school. Something about the features of "alma mater is a top school" and "chose to raise a family in Vermont, USA" (where I attended school) seemed to output a subset of teachers who were quite good. A professor from MIT taught me physics, a professor from Berkeley taught me Control Systems, and a professor from Cornell taught me Optimal Control, System Theory, and DSP. The foundational remnants from these courses is noticeably useful when I read machine learning texts today.
  
<p><a name ="identifier2">[2]</a> In this view, an electrical engineer minoring in math is a little like an economist minoring in finance. For most, finishing electrical engineering (economics) is sufficient evidence of strength in math (finance).
 
<p><a name ="identifier3:">[3]</a> DSP, it would turn out, also had its fair share of math.
  
<p><a name ="identifier4:">[4]</a> By efficiently solvable, I mean solvable in polynomial time, so again there is no guarantee of finding a solution linear in the relevant entity, but its much improved from having no pre-existing information. 

<p><a href="identifier5:">[5]</a> It would seem this way. As a 24-year-old I am not to be relied upon in this area.
